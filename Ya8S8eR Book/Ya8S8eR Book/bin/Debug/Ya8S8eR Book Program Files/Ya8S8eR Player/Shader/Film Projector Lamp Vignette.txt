// projector film lamp vignette
// This shader can be run as a screen space pixel shader.
// This shader requires compiling with ps_2_0, but higher is better, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_shader to look up what PS version your video card supports.
// If possible, avoid compiling with the software emulation modes (ps_?_sw). Pixel shaders require a lot of processing power to run in real-time software mode.
// Use this shader to apply an effect that looks like projecting trough film with an unstable lamp.

// fractions, either decimal or not, are allowed
// VignetteSize, interval [2, 9]
#define VignetteSize 4
// LampFlicker, interval [0., 1024.]
#define LampFlicker 192.
