// projector film sepia toning for SD&HD video input
// This shader should not be run as a screen space pixel shader.
// This shader requires compiling with ps_2_0, but higher is better, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_shader to look up what PS version your video card supports.
// If possible, avoid compiling with the software emulation modes (ps_?_sw). Pixel shaders require a lot of processing power to run in real-time software mode.
// If used in combination with other shaders and filters, place this and other Y'CbCr-type shaders at the beginning of the processing chain.
// Use this shader to apply an effect that looks like sepia film toning.
